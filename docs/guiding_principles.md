# Guiding Principles

> Loose thoughts that have guided the development of this work.

- Functional purity.
- Concise, readable code.
- Layout and style are related but distinct.
- Use the type system to help write correct UIs.
- Accessibility and localization are first-class.
- Explicitness > Implicit behavior. Boilerplate > magic. Throwaway-ability > Reusability
- Components abstract away layout.
- Influence from elm style elements
  - variants
  - hash guarded styles

## Other thoughts...

> "We do not think in terms of reusable components. Instead, we focus on reusable functions."

I don't think Hype should adopt this ideology. I think functions can be great abstractions for programmers. Furthermore, I think components are ideally just functions. However, I think the term "component" is more semantic and transcends the boundaries of engineering and design. It's an abstraction that we can all understand.
