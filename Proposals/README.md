# Proposals

Building out a core framework lays the foundation for future work. It is essential that the API (what is exposed from the framework) is carefully designed. A carefully designed API maximizes expressitivity, minimizes surface area, and is naturally discoverable. In order to meet these goals, proposals are encouraged to be submitted as Xcode Playground pages. This allows us to quickly understand and iterate on ideas in a concrete way.  

## Adding a proposal

1. Create a new Playground page in the `Proposals.playground`.
2. Name your page `XX-<title>` where `XX` is the next proposal number and `<title>` is a short name for your proposal.
3. Add the proposal header below.
4. Write your proposal and submit a PR! 

### Proposal header template

```
/* ------------------------------------------------------
Proposal: <proposal-title>
Author: <author>
Date: <month> <year>

<optional-short-description>
------------------------------------------------------ */
```

### Tips

- As you are writing, imagine you are walking someone through *discovering* what you are proposing.
- Start from first principles, that is, provide a context and gradually build up your proposal.
- It may be helpful to leave some open discussion questions at the end.
